                <h2>What is IPC?</h2>
                <p>IPC stands for Inter-Process Communication. It's like a special language that computer programs use
                    to talk to each other.</p>

                <h2>Why is IPC Important?</h2>
                <p>IPC helps different programs work together. Imagine your favorite video game needing to talk to your
                    computer's graphics and sound programs. IPC helps them communicate.</p>

                <h2>How Does IPC Work?</h2>
                <p>IPC can work in different ways. Some programs use messages to talk to each other, like passing notes
                    in class. Others use shared memory to share information, like sharing toys with friends.</p>

                <p>IPC is a big topic. If you want to learn more, ask your teacher or a grown-up for more resources and
                    fun activities to understand it better.</p>
